**What’s my favorite thing about providing support?**

I enjoy doing support because I love to help people solve their problems with the knowledge I have. At the core of why I enjoy doing support is because of the human interaction. From my experience, when I solve a problem for a user, and they’re happy, It’s always priceless when I get a positive feedback from them and it makes me fulfilled.

**What did you think of our service during the time you used it?  Provide either some constructive criticism or some points that impressed you.  Be honest!  “It sucked” isn’t a wrong answer unless you don’t elaborate and provide some constructive criticism ;)**

**Talk about how you made your site and why you chose the tools you did.  **

**Briefly explain a challenge you experienced in setting up this site and how you solved it.**

**Provide a link to documentation for a technical/developer-focused product, which you think are well done, and briefly explain why you think they are well done.**

https://en.support.wordpress.com/domains/map-existing-domain/

This documentation is straight to the point with easy steps and screenshots for a new user to comprehend. It also provides additional links that might be useful to the user. Also, it anticipates the needs of the user by providing links to options the user might be interested in.

**Why do you think SSL/HTTPS is important?**

It’s important because of security and SEO. Sites without SSL/HTTPS are prone to malicious attacks and most site visitors don’t trust a site without HTTPS. Therefore, it’s also important because it boosts the credibility of the site and improve the site’s ranking because of Google’s policy to rank such sites higher.

**Explain, in a couple of paragraphs, what you think 2 major challenges around DNS configuration are for less-technical internet end-users.**

The first challenge for less-technical internet end-users Another challenge is understanding how it works. Most of them do not know about DNS and and how it applies to their site. Another challenge is how to update their DNS. Most of them face this challenge when trying to point their domain to a new host. This can lead to errors while changing the records.

A customer writes in saying their “site won’t build”.  Compose:

•	your best short (2-paragraph) customer-facing answer, 

•	without any additional data, •	that could be useful in the generic case, 

•	but would also lead to a customer providing a more actionable response.Hi there,I’m happy to help. Can you please
